# Implementation Roadmap

Updated: 2026-10-03

This file tracks the stages built on top of saasmail's customer timeline, inbox
permissions, newsletters, sequences, MCP/WebMCP and delivery infrastructure.
The goal is one self-hosted system with two views over the same mail: the
person-centric **customer view** and a conventional **mailbox view**. The
native agent, MCP, WebMCP and JMAP are further clients of the same services.

## Status

Stages 1–7 are complete, including JMAP sending and the JMAP v1 follow-ups (#45–#66).
Stage 8 is deferred. Stages 9–11 are specified in [`docs/specs/`](docs/specs/) and
sequenced in [`docs/tasks/TASKS-stages-9-11.md`](docs/tasks/TASKS-stages-9-11.md).

A row with `—` is on a branch that hasn't merged yet; fill in the PR number and
squash commit when it lands.

The stage order isn't numeric because Stage 3 (the mailbox view) needed Stage
1's state model, while the agent (Stage 2) could land later.

## What each stage delivered

- **Stage 1: mail foundation.**
  - A message is exactly `emails ∪ sent_emails`, read only through
    `worker/src/lib/messages/query.ts`.
  - Per-user state (seen, starred) is kept separate from shared per-inbox state
    (archive, spam, trash, folders).
  - Conversation snooze has no cron: it's evaluated at read time and woken by
    new inbound mail.
  - See [docs/mailbox-state.md](docs/mailbox-state.md).
- **Stage 2: native agent.**
  - An `AIChatAgent` Durable Object per user session, with sessions, streaming
    and visible tool calls.
  - Per-inbox agent instructions, and suggested replies behind a
    prompt-injection screen.
  - The agent never sends mail.
  - See [docs/agent.md](docs/agent.md).
- **Stage 3: mailbox view.**
  - Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Starred, Snoozed, Archive, Spam, Trash and user
    folders for each inbox.
  - Bulk actions and keyboard shortcuts.
  - A per-inbox spam threshold.
- **Stage 4: one automations engine.**
  - `message.received` rules: conditions are ANDed and there's no regex.
  - Actions: archive, spam, folder, snooze, assign, and auto-reply with
    loop/flood guards.
  - Conversation assignment.
  - See [docs/automations.md](docs/automations.md).
- **Stage 5: identity graph.**
  - Manual linking of several addresses into one customer; merging two
    existing customers is admin-only.
  - See [docs/customers.md](docs/customers.md).
- **Stage 6: agent CRM actions.**
  - Enroll, cancel, add to list, assign, and link customer. Each needs
    per-call human approval on a signed approval card.
- **Stage 7: JMAP.**
  - An RFC 8620/8621 core subset: Session, `Mailbox/*`, `Email/*`,
    `Thread/get`, `Identity/get`, and `Email/set` for keywords and mailbox
    membership.
  - A trigger-based change log.
  - Sending (7c): RFC 8620-valid ids, blob upload and download, drafts with a
    stored RFC 5322 form, and `EmailSubmission` with the RFC 8621 on-success
    update, as transactional one-To messages through the shared outbox.
  - See [docs/jmap.md](docs/jmap.md).

- **Stage 9: trust and safety** (specified, not built). Replies follow
  Reply-To; an audit log fed by every channel; idempotency keys on sends; a
  pause switch that holds the outbox, an `MCP_SEND_ENABLED` kill switch and
  daily caps per channel; TOTP second factor with recovery codes and D1-backed
  auth rate limits.
- **Stage 10: triage** (specified, not built). A `reject` rule action evaluated
  before storage and optional rejection of unknown recipients; folder colours
  and descriptions with an `ai_file` rule action; a per-inbox Bayes spam
  filter trained by the team's junk marks, exposed as a `spam_probability`
  condition; last, header-based threading as a per-inbox option.
- **Stage 11: data ownership** (specified, not built). mbox export and `.eml`
  download; mbox/eml import through the shared inbound storage helper; daily
  logical D1 backups to R2 with a CLI restore.

## Deferred

- **Stage 8, portability (a non-Cloudflare runtime):** only on real demand.
- **JMAP follow-ups:** search snippets and vacation response.
- **Snooze-expiry notifications:** there is no wake-up cron by design.
- **Calendar, invites and booking pages:** a second product; revisit booking
  links on the customer timeline after stage 10.

## Principles

1. A message is `emails ∪ sent_emails`: no third source, and delivery machinery
   is not mail. Drafts, from the web composer or from JMAP, are unsent client
   state, not mail.
2. D1 is the system of record. Durable Objects are for coordination and agent
   session state only.
3. One permission-checked service layer serves HTTP, MCP, WebMCP, the native
   agent and JMAP.
4. Personal state stays separate from shared state.
5. A human confirms before anything is sent or any CRM change is made.
6. Changes are additive: new tables and modules, never reshaped upstream
   tables.
7. Limits live at the boundary (HTTP/MCP/JMAP), not in internal services.
