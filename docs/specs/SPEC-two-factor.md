# SPEC: Sign-in rate limits that hold across Workers (two-factor sign-in dropped)

> **Re-scoped during implementation (2026-10-04).** Only decision 5, the durable auth rate limits,
> shipped. TOTP, recovery codes, the admin reset and the `password_sign_in_with_passkey` setting were
> dropped: in production a password cannot sign in to an account that has a passkey, so a second
> factor after the password would guard nothing. See "Spec changes" at the end. The rest of this page
> is the spec as written.

Stage 9 (trust and safety), slice 5 of 5. Depends on `docs/archive/SPEC-audit-log.md` (events). Label `minor`.

## Why

The passkey gate forces every user to _register_ a passkey, but `LoginPage` still accepts
email + password alone, and `passkeyRequired()` only checks that a passkey exists. A leaked password is
a full session: all mail the user can see, every API key they can create, every inbox they may send
from. Mailflare ships TOTP with recovery codes; better-auth 1.6.28 (already our auth library) ships a
`twoFactor` plugin that does exactly that and leaves passkey sign-in alone (its hook covers
`/sign-in/email`, `/sign-in/username` and `/sign-in/phone-number`, verified in
`node_modules/better-auth/dist/plugins/two-factor/index.mjs`).

Also: better-auth's rate limiter is in-memory, i.e. per isolate on Workers. A TOTP code is six digits,
so the verification endpoint needs a limiter that holds across isolates.

## Decisions (proposed 2026-10-03)

1. Per-user opt-in TOTP, with 10 single-use recovery codes, through better-auth's `twoFactor` plugin.
   It applies to password sign-in only; passkey sign-in is already two factors and bypasses it, which
   is the intended behaviour, not a gap.
2. An admin can reset (disable) a locked-out user's second factor. Admins see who has it on.
3. Optional setting `password_sign_in_with_passkey: "allowed" | "blocked"` (default `allowed`). When
   `blocked`, a user who has a passkey cannot sign in with a password at all ("Use your passkey").
   This is the strongest option for teams that want it and costs one hook; it stays off by default
   because the e2e suite and `DISABLE_PASSKEY_GATE` dev flows sign in with passwords.
4. Forcing every user to enable TOTP is out of scope: the passkey gate already guarantees a
   phishing-resistant factor is registered for every account, and better-auth cannot tell a password
   session from a passkey session after the fact.
5. Auth rate limiting moves to D1 (`customStorage` with an atomic `consume`), keyed by
   `cf-connecting-ip`, so the plugin's `/two-factor/*` rule (3 requests per 10 s) and the default
   sign-in rules hold across isolates. Sessions are untouched.

## 1. Server

**Files:** `worker/src/auth/index.ts`, `worker/src/db/auth.schema.ts` (regenerated), new
`worker/src/auth/rate-limit-storage.ts`, `worker/src/db/auth-rate-limits.schema.ts`, `schema.ts`,
migrations, `helpers.ts`, `worker-configuration.d.ts`, `wrangler.jsonc.example`.

- Plugin: `twoFactor({ issuer: env?.TWO_FACTOR_ISSUER ?? "saasmail", skipVerificationOnEnable: false,
backupCodeOptions: { amount: 10 } })` added to `plugins`. `yarn auth:generate` regenerates
  `auth.schema.ts` (adds `twoFactors` and `users.twoFactorEnabled`); then `yarn db:generate`; then
  `applyMigrations()` in `helpers.ts`.
- Rate limiting: `rateLimit: { enabled: !isDevEnvironment(env), window: 60, max: 60, customStorage:
d1RateLimitStorage(db) }` and `advanced.ipAddress.ipAddressHeaders: ["cf-connecting-ip"]`.
  `d1RateLimitStorage` implements `get`, `set` and `consume` over

  ```
  auth_rate_limits (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, count INTEGER NOT NULL, window_start INTEGER NOT NULL,
                    expires_at INTEGER NOT NULL)
  ```

  `consume(key, rule)`: one statement — `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET count = CASE WHEN
expires_at <= now THEN 1 ELSE count + 1 END, window_start = CASE … END, expires_at = CASE … END
RETURNING count, expires_at` — then `allowed = count <= rule.max`, `retryAfter = expires_at - now`.
  Expired rows are pruned in the hourly chain (1,000 per pass).

- Hooks (`hooks.before` / `hooks.after`):
  - `before /sign-in/email`: when `password_sign_in_with_passkey === "blocked"`, look the user up by
    email; if they have a passkey → `APIError("FORBIDDEN", { code: "PASSKEY_SIGN_IN_REQUIRED",
message: "Use your passkey to sign in." })`. Unknown emails fall through to the normal failure
    (no account enumeration).
  - `after /sign-in/email`, `/passkey/verify-authentication`, `/two-factor/verify-totp`,
    `/two-factor/verify-backup-code`:
    emit `auth.sign_in` (method `password`, `passkey`, `totp`, `recovery_code`) or `auth.sign_in_failed`.
  - `after /two-factor/enable` (completed by the first `verify-totp`), `/two-factor/disable`: emit
    `user.two_factor_enabled` / `user.two_factor_disabled`.
- Admin reset: `POST /api/admin/users/{id}/two-factor/reset` (admin, passkey-gated, not for yourself):
  deletes the user's `twoFactors` row, sets `users.two_factor_enabled = 0`, emits
  `user.two_factor_reset`. `GET /api/admin/users` gains `twoFactorEnabled` per user.
- The session user returned by better-auth (`useSession()` on the client) carries `twoFactorEnabled`;
  the plugin adds the field, so no saasmail route changes for it.

## 2. Client and pages

**Files:** `src/lib/auth-client.ts`, `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`, new `src/pages/TwoFactorPage.tsx`,
`src/App.tsx` (`/two-factor`), `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` (Security section),
`src/pages/AdminUsersPage.tsx`, `package.json` (`qrcode.react`, exact pin, `yarn install
--update-checksums`).

- `twoFactorClient({ onTwoFactorRedirect() { window.location.assign("/two-factor") } })` in the auth
  client. `LoginPage`: after `signIn.email` resolves with `twoFactorRedirect`, navigate to
  `/two-factor`; a `PASSKEY_SIGN_IN_REQUIRED` error switches the page to passkey mode with the message.
- `/two-factor`: six-digit input (auto-submit on the sixth digit), "Trust this device" checkbox
  (`trustDevice: true`), "Use a recovery code instead" (switches to a text field →
  `verifyBackupCode`), errors from the server verbatim, a "Back to sign-in" link. Unauthenticated
  layout like LoginPage.
- Settings → Security:
  - Status line ("Two-factor sign-in is off / on since …").
  - **Turn on**: password prompt → `twoFactor.enable({ password })` → QR (`qrcode.react` `QRCodeSVG`
    of `totpURI`) + "Can't scan? Enter this key" (the secret from the URI) → code input →
    `verifyTotp({ code })` → the recovery codes, shown once with Copy and Download (.txt) and a
    "I saved them" confirmation → done.
  - **Turn off**: password prompt → `twoFactor.disable({ password })`.
  - **New recovery codes**: password prompt → `generateBackupCodes({ password })`, shown once.
  - Passkeys: the existing list/add/remove (`/api/user/passkeys`, `SetupPasskeyPage`) is linked or
    embedded here; removal emits `user.passkey_removed` through the `/passkey/delete-passkey` hook.
- Admin → Users: a "2FA" column (On/Off) and a "Reset 2FA" action with a confirmation that names the
  user.
- Settings → Security (admins): the `password_sign_in_with_passkey` select with a sentence explaining
  the effect and the dev-flow caveat.

## Tests

- Worker: `twoFactor` is in the plugin list; `consume` admits `max` and refuses `max + 1` within the
  window, resets after it, and two concurrent consumes count both; the `blocked` hook refuses a
  passkey user's password sign-in and lets a passkey-less user through; the admin reset route clears
  the row, refuses non-admins and self; the `twoFactorEnabled` field.
- Web (vitest): `/two-factor` submits the code and the trust flag; the recovery-code path; Settings
  enable flow renders the QR and the codes once; Login handles `twoFactorRedirect` and
  `PASSKEY_SIGN_IN_REQUIRED`.
- e2e: unchanged flows still pass (the setting defaults to `allowed`; the e2e user has no TOTP). One new
  e2e: enable TOTP in Settings with a known secret (generate codes with `otpauth` in the test), sign out,
  sign in with password → `/two-factor` → code → dashboard.

## Docs and CHANGELOG

- `docs/users-and-api-keys.md`: a "Two-factor sign-in" section (how it relates to passkeys, recovery
  codes, admin reset, the passkey-only setting). `docs/configuration.md`: `TWO_FACTOR_ISSUER`
  (optional). `docs/updating.md`: run `yarn db:migrate:prod` (new auth tables) before deploying.
- CHANGELOG `### Added`: **Two-factor sign-in.** … and **Sign-in rate limits hold across Workers.** …

## Spec changes (implementation)

The spec was written believing that a leaked password is a full session. In production it is not:

- Since the passkey gate shipped, `POST /api/auth/sign-in/email` is refused with
  `403 PASSKEY_REQUIRED_FOR_SIGNIN` for every account that has a passkey, before better-auth sees the
  request (`worker/src/index.ts`). Only `DISABLE_PASSKEY_GATE=true` (local development) and
  `DEMO_MODE` skip that.
- An account without a passkey does get a session, but every `/api` route refuses it
  (`403 PASSKEY_REQUIRED`) except `/api/user/passkeys`: it can register a first passkey and nothing
  else.

What changed, and why:

1. **Decisions 1 and 2 (TOTP with recovery codes, the admin reset) are dropped.** A code after the
   password would only ever be asked of accounts with no passkey, whose session can do nothing but
   register one, and such an account cannot have turned TOTP on (Settings is behind the same gate). It
   would guard nothing while adding two sign-in flows, a table, a QR dependency and an admin action.
   The exposure that is left is that window: someone who learns an invited user's password before that
   user registers a passkey can register theirs first. Closing it needs a different control, such as
   binding the first passkey registration to the invitation; that would be a new spec.
2. **Decision 3 (`password_sign_in_with_passkey`, default `allowed`) is dropped.** What it offered as
   an option is already unconditional in production, and its default would have loosened it.
3. **Decision 5 shipped**, with these differences:
   - Rate limiting was not on at all: better-auth enables it only when `NODE_ENV` is `"production"`,
     which Workers do not set. It is now on everywhere but local development and demo deploys
     (`isDevEnvironment`), counted in `auth_rate_limits` (migration 0078) through `customStorage`.
   - better-auth's built-in rules are kept (3 attempts per 10 seconds per address on `/sign-in/*`,
     `/sign-up/*`, `/change-password`, `/change-email`; 3 per minute on password-reset paths; 100 per
     10 seconds elsewhere) instead of a global 60 per minute, which would have throttled ordinary
     traffic from a shared office address. `/get-session` is not limited: it guards nothing and would
     cost a D1 write on every page load. The `/two-factor/*` rule went with the plugin.
   - The key is better-auth's (`<address>|<path>`), and the address is `cf-connecting-ip`
     (`advanced.ipAddress.ipAddressHeaders`), which also makes the session records' addresses right.
     Times are in milliseconds. `consume` is one upsert that resets a closed window and counts refused
     requests too; a D1 error lets the request through and logs, rather than locking everybody out.
   - A request refused by the limiter is answered before better-auth's hooks, so it is not recorded in
     the audit log as a failed sign-in. The password pre-check for passkey accounts runs before the
     limiter and is not counted (it never checks a password).
4. No `auth.sign_in` methods `totp`/`recovery_code`, no `user.two_factor_*` events, no
   `TWO_FACTOR_ISSUER`, no web changes: the login page already shows the server's "Too many requests"
   message.
