# SPEC: Sending controls — pause switch, agent kill switch, daily caps

Stage 9 (trust and safety), slice 4 of 5. Depends on `docs/archive/SPEC-audit-log.md` (events) and
`docs/archive/SPEC-send-idempotency.md` (shared boundary code in the send routes). Label `minor`.

## Why

When something goes wrong — a misconfigured rule auto-replying in a loop, an agent client with a bad
prompt, a leaked API key, a campaign sent to the wrong list — there is no way to stop outbound mail
short of redeploying or deleting the sender's API key. Mailroom has `MCP_SEND_ENABLED=false` (every
agent loses its send tools at once) and a daily cap per identity. Mailflare has none of this; we should
have both, and a pause that loses nothing.

## Decisions (proposed 2026-10-03)

1. **Pause holds, never drops.** Admins toggle "Pause outbound sending" in Settings. While paused,
   every send path still writes its `sent_emails` and `outbox_emails` rows, but no attempt is made:
   `sendViaOutbox` skips the inline attempt and `processOutbox` returns early. Resuming lets the
   hourly processor (and an immediate run triggered by the resume) deliver what accumulated. Nothing
   is refused, nothing is lost, the audit log says who paused and when.
2. **`MCP_SEND_ENABLED` env var** (default on; `"false"` disables): the MCP tools that cause mail —
   `send_email`, `reply_email`, `send_template`, `enroll_sequence` — refuse with a clear error. They stay
   listed (the inventory test is unchanged, and clients see the explanation instead of a missing tool).
   This is the deploy-time kill switch for every connected agent at once; the pause is the runtime one
   for everything.
3. **Daily caps per user per channel, counted at acceptance** (one per accepted message, before the
   outbox). Settings: `daily_send_limit_mcp` (default 200), `daily_send_limit_api` (API-key callers,
   default unlimited), `daily_send_limit_web` (default unlimited), `daily_send_limit_jmap` (default
   unlimited). `null` = unlimited, `0` = blocked. Campaigns and sequences are not counted: they have
   `PROVIDER_DAILY_SEND_LIMIT` and their own ledgers. Over the cap: HTTP `429 DAILY_SEND_LIMIT_REACHED`
   with `Retry-After` = seconds to the next UTC midnight; MCP tool error with the same text; JMAP
   `EmailSubmission/set` `notCreated` with `forbiddenToSend` and a description.
4. The day is the UTC date. Counters live in D1 and are incremented atomically; the check is
   increment-then-compare, so two concurrent sends cannot both squeeze under the cap.

## 1. Pause

**Files:** `worker/src/lib/outbox.ts` (`sendViaOutbox`, `processOutbox`), `worker/src/lib/sending-controls.ts`
(new: `isSendingPaused(db)`, `setSendingPaused(db, actor, paused)`, cached per request), `worker/src/routers/admin-router.ts`
(`/settings`), `worker/src/routers/outbox-router.ts` (`/count` gains `held`), `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`,
`src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` (banner), `src/pages/ComposeModal.tsx`.

- `app_settings` key `outbound_paused`: JSON `{ "since": <unix>, "byUserId": "…", "byLabel": "…" }`, or
  absent. Written only through the admin settings route (admin, passkey-gated).
- `sendViaOutbox`: after inserting the row, if paused → set `next_retry_at = now` (so it is "due" the
  moment sending resumes), return `{ outcome: "retrying", send: <no provider call>, outboxId }` and
  the send-path callers record the sent row with their existing `retrying` handling. No provider is
  called. `processOutbox`: `if (await isSendingPaused(db)) return;` before claiming rows. The JMAP
  delayed-send release goes through `sendViaOutbox` and is therefore held too; the submission stays
  `pending`.
- Resume: the route clears the key, emits `sending.resumed`, and `ctx.waitUntil(processOutbox(env))`
  so held mail goes out within seconds, not at the next hour.
- API/MCP responses while paused keep their shape; `status` is `"retrying"` and a new boolean
  `paused: true` is added to the send response schemas so a client can tell the difference.
- UI: a banner on every page for admins ("Outbound sending is paused since 14:02 by Jane. Resume") and
  a one-line notice above the Send button in composers for everyone ("Sending is paused; your message
  will be queued"). Settings → Sending: the toggle, who/when, and the held count from
  `GET /api/outbox/count`.

## 2. MCP kill switch

**Files:** `worker/src/mcp/server.ts`, `worker-configuration.d.ts` / `wrangler.jsonc.example`,
`docs/configuration.md`, `docs/mcp.md`.

- `env.MCP_SEND_ENABLED === "false"` → the four tools' handlers return the MCP error
  `MCP_SEND_DISABLED: "Sending through MCP is disabled on this server by its administrator."` before
  any work (checked inside the scope wrapper so the scope error still wins for unscoped tokens).
- The tool descriptions do not change; `whoami` gains `sendEnabled: boolean` so a client can know up
  front.

## 3. Daily caps

**Files:** `worker/src/db/send-counters.schema.ts` (+ `schema.ts`, migration, `helpers.ts`),
`worker/src/lib/sending-controls.ts` (`reserveDailySend(db, { userId, channel, limit })`),
`worker/src/routers/send-router.ts`, `worker/src/routers/email-templates-router.ts`, `worker/src/mcp/server.ts`,
`worker/src/jmap/submission.ts`, `worker/src/routers/admin-router.ts`, `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`.

```
send_counters (user_id TEXT NOT NULL, channel TEXT NOT NULL, day TEXT NOT NULL /* YYYY-MM-DD UTC */,
               count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, PRIMARY KEY (user_id, channel, day))
```

- `reserveDailySend`: reads the channel's limit from `app_settings` (`null` → return `allowed`
  without touching the table); `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET count = count + 1 RETURNING count`;
  if `count > limit` → `UPDATE … SET count = count - 1` and return `{ allowed: false, retryAfter }`.
  Called once per accepted message in each boundary, after validation and the idempotency claim
  (a replay never counts) and before `sendEmail`/`replyToEmail`/`submitMessage`. Channel comes from the
  audit actor (`web`, `api`, `mcp`, `jmap`).
- Over the cap also emits `send.limit_reached` once per user/channel/day (the first refusal), so the
  log isn't flooded.
- Rows older than 7 days are pruned in the hourly chain.
- Settings → Sending: four numeric fields (blank = unlimited) with the per-channel count today for the
  signed-in admin's team (`GET /api/admin/send-usage?day=` → counts grouped by channel and user, top 20).

## 4. Settings route

`PATCH /api/admin/settings` (the existing route) accepts `outboundPaused: boolean`,
`dailySendLimits: { mcp, api, web, jmap: number | null }`; each change emits `settings.changed`
(and `sending.paused`/`sending.resumed` for the toggle). `GET /api/config` (`bootstrap-router.ts`, which already
serves `brandName` and `webmcpEnabled`) exposes `outboundPaused` and `dailySendLimits` so the banner and
composers can render without an admin call.

## Tests

- Pause: `sendViaOutbox` writes the row and calls no provider when paused; `processOutbox` is a no-op;
  resume processes the held row; the JMAP delayed release is held.
- Kill switch: each of the four tools refuses with `MCP_SEND_DISABLED` when the var is `"false"`;
  `whoami.sendEnabled`; inventory unchanged.
- Caps: the 201st MCP send of a UTC day is refused with the right `Retry-After`; two concurrent sends at
  the boundary admit exactly one; `null` never touches the table; a replayed idempotent send doesn't
  count; JMAP returns `forbiddenToSend`; prune.
- Web (vitest): banner and composer notice; settings form round-trips.

## Docs and CHANGELOG

- `docs/configuration.md`: `MCP_SEND_ENABLED`. New section "Sending controls" in `docs/users-and-api-keys.md`
  or a new `docs/sending.md` (pause, caps, what counts). `docs/mcp.md`: the kill switch and the cap
  error. `docs/jmap.md`: `forbiddenToSend` when over the cap.
- CHANGELOG `### Added`: **Pause outbound sending, agent kill switch and daily send caps.** …
