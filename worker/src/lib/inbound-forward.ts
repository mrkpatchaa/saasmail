/**
 * Per-inbox forwarding ("redirect rule").
 *
 * Why this exists instead of a Cloudflare Email Routing forwarding rule:
 * Email Routing relays forwarded mail from a shared IP pool, and Outlook /
 * Hotmail / Live blocklist parts of it. The bounce looks like:
 *
 *   permanent error (550): 5.7.1 Unfortunately, messages from [104.30.10.66]
 *   weren't sent ... part of their network is on our block list (S3150).
 *
 * That IP is Cloudflare's, not ours, so we can't get it delisted — anyone whose
 * personal mailbox is Microsoft-hosted just stops receiving forwards. Re-sending
 * the message ourselves through the configured outbound provider (Cloudflare
 * Email Sending / Resend / Bavimail / Postmark) leaves from different IPs and is
 * DKIM-signed for our own domain, so it authenticates cleanly.
 *
 * The consequence, and the central trade-off of this module: the forwarded copy
 * is a re-composition, not a byte-for-byte relay. We cannot keep the original
 * `From:` — sending as `customer@example.com` from our infrastructure fails SPF
 * and has no DKIM signature for that domain, so it fails DMARC and gets filtered
 * harder than the block we're routing around. Instead we send as the inbox, put
 * the real sender in `Reply-To`, and restate the original envelope in a header
 * block at the top of the body, the same way "forward as new message" works in
 * any mail client.
 */

/**
 * Trip-wire header stamped on every forward, used to break forwarding loops.
 *
 * Provider caveat: Bavimail's API has no generic custom-header field, so this
 * (and the two X- headers below) are dropped on that provider. Loop protection
 * there degrades to the self and same-instance destination checks, which still
 * cover the realistic cases; only the indirect "destination forwards back to us"
 * loop goes uncaught.
