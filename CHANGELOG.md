# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **A campaign now owns its content, and is edited on the campaign page.** Previously a campaign pointed at a template and its body could not be changed after creation, which forced one throwaway template per campaign and left "template" meaning nothing reusable. `campaigns` gains `format`, `body_json` and `body_html`; `template_slug` becomes optional and means _start from this_ — the template's content is copied in once at creation, and the campaign owns it from then on. Editing or deleting that template afterwards cannot reach back into a campaign started from it.

  Templates are unchanged for the transactional and sequence paths, where a template genuinely is the content and carries a `{{variable}}` send contract. Creating a campaign now redirects to the campaign itself rather than back to the list, and a campaign with an empty body is refused at send time instead of mailing a blank page.

### Added

- **A block editor for newsletter templates.** A template now records how it was authored in a `format` column: `html` is the raw-HTML editor that has always existed, and `block` is a new visual editor built on Tiptap. Seven block types — heading, paragraph, list, quote, image, button, separator — arranged in an editor whose live preview is compiled by the same module the worker runs on save, so the preview is the email rather than an approximation of it. Multi-column layouts are deliberately not supported.

  `bodyHtml` remains the single rendering source for every send path. A block template compiles into it server-side on write, so campaign snapshots, sequence steps, the send API, variable analysis and link rewriting are unchanged and never learn that blocks exist. `{{variable}}` tags work inside blocks exactly as they do in HTML templates — including as a whole link target, which is what `{{unsubscribe_url}}` needs.

  Rich text inside a block is restricted to bold, italic, underline, strikethrough and links, enforced by a server-side allowlist sanitizer that runs on every write path (the template API accepts block documents directly, so client-side sanitization would not be a control). Converting a block template to HTML is allowed and one-way; the reverse is refused with `422`, because parsing arbitrary email HTML back into blocks would silently discard layout.

- **Hosted images for newsletters.** `POST /api/newsletter-assets` stores an image and returns a public, immutable URL under `/newsletter-images/{id}` that a subscriber's mail client can fetch months later with no credentials. PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP up to 5 MB; the format and dimensions are read from the file header, so a file is accepted for what its bytes are rather than what it claims to be, and SVG is excluded as a scriptable document. Identical bytes de-duplicate to one stored object. Uploads are refused in `DEMO_MODE`.

  Newsletter images are never garbage-collected: one referenced by a sent campaign has to outlive the template that introduced it, because the campaign's frozen `htmlSnapshot` still points at that URL. See [`docs/newsletters.md`](docs/newsletters.md).

### Changed

- The remote MCP server identifies itself with the instance's brand name instead of the hardcoded string `saasmail`. It reports the `brand_name` app setting as `serverInfo.name` and `serverInfo.title` in the MCP handshake, and publishes it as RFC 9728 `resource_name` in `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, so an operator connecting two saasmail deployments to the same client can tell them apart wherever the client names a connector from discovery. Unset brand name still reports `saasmail`. Clients that ask for a connection name themselves (`claude mcp add <name>`, the key in an `mcpServers` block) are unaffected — those labels are local.
- **Docs split out of the README.** The 790-line README is now a 135-line overview — what saasmail is, quickstart, screenshots, cost, and a linked feature index — and the reference material moved into [`docs/`](docs/README.md) as 14 cross-linked pages with an index at `docs/README.md`: setup, email providers, configuration, updating, architecture, local development, inboxes, templates, sequences, suppressions, users and API keys, MCP, WebMCP, and webhooks. Every page carries a breadcrumb back to the index. Prose is unchanged apart from rewritten cross-links; nothing was dropped. Old deep links still work: every heading the README used to carry is redeclared as an anchor on the line that replaced it, so `README.md#template-syntax` lands on the Email templates entry and `README.md#local-development` on the documentation index.
- The README's ASCII architecture sketch is now a rendered diagram, in light and dark variants selected with `prefers-color-scheme`. It is generated rather than hand-drawn: self-contained HTML sources live in `docs/diagrams/`, skinned with the product's own design tokens from `src/index.css` (lime primary, violet for external provider calls), and exported to PNG at 2×.

### Security

- Attachment reads are scoped to the caller's allowed inboxes. `GET /api/attachments/{id}` and `/{id}/inline` looked the attachment up by id alone, so any authenticated user could read any attachment in the deployment given only its id. Both routes now resolve the owning inbox through the attachment's message — `emails.recipient` for inbound, `sent_emails.from_address` for sent — and answer `404` when it is not allowed, so the response does not confirm the id exists.
- Inline attachments are served with `Cache-Control: private` instead of `public`, so shared caches in front of the worker cannot store authenticated mailbox content and hand it to a different caller.
- Attachment downloads sanitize the filename before interpolating it into `Content-Disposition` and add an RFC 5987 `filename*` field, so a stored filename carrying quotes or CR/LF can no longer inject headers or split the response.

### Fixed

- `PATCH /api/emails/bulk` works. It was registered after `PATCH /api/emails/{id}`, and Hono matches in registration order, so the request bound `id: "bulk"`, was answered by the single-email handler, and returned `404` without marking anything — the bulk handler was unreachable dead code. Registering it before the parameterised route makes it live; it applies the same inbox scoping it always contained, silently skipping ids the caller may not access.
- Inbox list: hydrate group participants/CC after pagination so `GET /api/people/grouped` no longer 500s on mailboxes with 50+ group threads (D1's 100 bound-parameter cap). Stats still counted unread while the people list failed empty.
- Blocklist: mark matching unread mail as read when a rule is created, so the nav unread badge cannot stick on senders the inbox list has hidden. Migration `0033` clears existing blocked unread counts.
- README: correct OpenAPI doc URLs (`/doc` and `/swagger-ui`, not `/api/doc`) and OpenAPI version (3.0).

### Added

- **Newsletters: lists, subscribe forms, and campaigns.** Bulk marketing mail, kept separate from the transactional and sequence paths that share the worker. Documented in [`docs/newsletters.md`](docs/newsletters.md).
  - **Subscribers are `contacts`, not `people`.** `people` drives the inbox list, which is ordered by last contact — importing ten thousand subscribers into it would bury every real correspondent. The two are linked but never merged: a campaign send fills in `contacts.personId` only when a `people` row already exists, and never creates one. The hourly pass backfills the link for subscribers who later turn up in `people` on their own.
  - **Lists and members** with full consent provenance (`consentSource`, `consentAt`, `importJobId`). Removing a member is a status change, never a row delete — the row is the answer to "why do we have this address?". A list with campaign history is archived rather than dropped. CSV export is formula-injection-safe; CSV import is a resumable, cancellable background job with progress in the UI.
  - **Subscribe forms** — public `POST /subscribe/{formId}` with a honeypot, `subscribe_attempts`-backed rate limiting per form+email and per IP, and an origin check that fails closed. Attempt rows store a digest of the address, never the address. Double opt-in mails a confirmation link and holds the member at `pending` until it is followed; an expired link answers `410` so the page can offer a fresh signup.
  - **Campaigns** with an explicit state machine — anything unlisted answers `409`, because a campaign is real mail to real people and an unspecified transition should fail loudly rather than do something plausible. Content is frozen on send, so editing the source template cannot change mail already going out. Fan-out is cursor-paged and resumable, each recipient is claimed with one atomic `UPDATE … RETURNING` so a duplicate queue delivery sends nothing twice, and a crash between "provider accepted" and "we wrote it down" self-heals on the next hourly pass instead of re-sending. A campaign scheduled more than 24 hours ago moves to `overdue` rather than firing silently.
  - **Per-list unsubscribe.** Campaign mail carries a v2 token naming the list, campaign and contact: clicking it leaves that list rather than suppressing the address globally. Legacy v1 tokens keep their global-suppression meaning and keep verifying. The same URL appears in the body, the footer and both `List-Unsubscribe*` headers, including after an outbox retry. One-click undo is available for 7 days, then a fresh opt-in is required — a token lives in an email forever.
  - **Open and click tracking**, with a per-recipient pixel and opaque per-recipient redirects. A click token carries a link id, never a URL: HMAC protects integrity, not confidentiality, and campaign links can themselves carry signed parameters. Subscribe-confirm, unsubscribe, open and click tokens use four keys derived from `UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET`, so a token leaked from one context cannot be replayed against another. The text part is deliberately not link-rewritten. Counts are labelled `~opens`/`~clicks`: Apple Mail Privacy Protection pre-fetches every pixel and some proxies pre-fetch links, so both over-count.
  - **Retention and subject rights.** Concrete windows — signup attempts 24h, submission IPs 30d, engagement events 13 months, undo 7d — each swept in bounded batches by the hourly cron. `GET /api/contacts/{email}/export` answers a subject-access request; `POST /api/contacts/{email}/erase` replaces the address with a keyed one-way pseudonym everywhere while keeping the rows, which are the evidence that a suppression or consent happened.
  - **WebMCP gains four read tools** (`list_newsletter_lists`, `get_newsletter_list`, `list_campaigns`, `get_campaign_stats`) and deliberately no newsletter action tools. A send is irreversible and reaches thousands of strangers at once — exactly the capability that should stay behind a human click.
  - Fan-out and link storage write in chunks sized by D1's cap on bound variables per statement. A 100-recipient page in one INSERT is 1200 variables and fails outright with `too many SQL variables`; the page size stays 100 because it is the coordinator's unit of work, not a statement size.
  - New setting `PROVIDER_DAILY_SEND_LIMIT` (unset by default) refuses to start a campaign that would push the sending identity past a daily quota, rather than discovering it half-delivered.

- **WebMCP support.** The web app now registers 20 WebMCP tools (`document.modelContext`) so a browser AI agent — ChatGPT's in-app browser, or Chrome 149+ with `chrome://flags/#enable-webmcp-testing` — can operate saasmail from inside the logged-in page using the session cookie. Read tools (search, list, and read mail/contacts/templates/sequences) return data; action tools drive the visible UI — navigating to a contact, opening the compose drawer pre-filled, drafting a reply into the inbox **Drafts** filter, enrolling a contact in a sequence and switching to the **Sequenced** filter. `get_playbook` briefs the agent on how to run common workflows (summarize unread, reply to unread, enroll by criteria), and `visualize_plan` renders its live step-by-step plan on a new **Agent Plan** inbox tab so the user can watch progress during long inference. **WebMCP never sends or deletes:** compose and reply produce drafts the signed-in user reviews and sends by hand. A bottom-right **activity popup** surfaces each tool call as it runs (running → done/error) so the agent's work is never invisible. This complements, and differs from, the existing remote `/mcp` server (OAuth 2.1, for external agents): WebMCP is in-page, session-scoped, and can only do what the signed-in user can. Turn it off per instance with the `webmcp_enabled` app setting. Adds `GET /api/emails/search` and a `Permissions-Policy: tools=(self)` header on the app HTML.
- **Per-inbox forwarding.** Admins can set an optional destination address per inbox on the **Inboxes** page (alongside display name, signature, mode, and members). Every message the inbox receives is re-sent to that address through the configured outbound provider. This exists because Cloudflare Email Routing's own forwarding rules relay from shared IPs that Outlook/Hotmail blocklist (`550 5.7.1 … S3150`), so those forwards bounce; re-sending leaves from different IPs and is DKIM-signed for your own domain. Copies are sent from the inbox address with the original sender in `Reply-To`. Off by default. Migration `0031`.
- OpenAPI email responses: document `attachments` on `EmailSchema`, clarify `replyTo` is only populated on `GET /api/emails/{id}` for received messages.
- OpenAPI `/doc`: register `SendEmailSchema`, `CcEntry`, and `ReplyEmailSchema` under `components.schemas` (including `transactional` and reply payload fields).
- OpenAPI `/doc`: global auth documentation, `BearerAuth` security scheme, and `security` requirements on integrator-facing routes (`/api/send`, template send, sequence enroll, API keys).
- OpenAPI sequences: `fromAddress` and typed `variables` on `EnrollmentSchema`; document enroll and delete error responses (400/404).
- OpenAPI send paths: document multipart parse errors (400/413), inbox permission 403, and reply/template-not-found 404 on `/api/send`, `/api/send/reply/{emailId}`, and `/api/email-templates/{slug}/send`.
- OpenAPI bootstrap: add unauthenticated `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/config` to the generated spec.
- OpenAPI notifications: convert `notifications-router` to zod-openapi; document config, WebSocket stream, push subscribe/unsubscribe, and subscription management routes.
- New outbound email provider: **Postmark**. Set `POSTMARK_API_KEY` (your Postmark server API token) as a secret to send through Postmark. Runtime precedence is Bavimail > Postmark > Resend > Cloudflare Email Sending.
- Mustache-style sections in templates: `{{#items}}…{{/items}}` renders
  conditionally and iterates arrays, `{{^items}}…{{/items}}` inverts, and
  `{{.}}` refers to the current item. (#112)
- `{{key?}}` marks a variable optional — it renders empty instead of failing
  the send, so a template can add a variable before every caller supplies it. (#227)
- `{{key|nl2br}}` converts newlines to `<br>` after escaping, for multi-line
  values such as message bodies and address blocks. (#227)
- Malformed templates now fail with a `400` carrying the parse diagnostic
  (internally `TEMPLATE_PARSE_ERROR`) instead of rendering something
  half-formed. Unbalanced or mismatched section tags (`{{#items}}` with no
  `{{/items}}`, `{{/other}}` closing the wrong section) and unknown filters
  are parse errors. This is a new failure mode on
  `POST /api/email-templates/{slug}/send`,
  `GET /api/email-templates/{slug}/variables`, and
  `POST /api/send/reply/{id}` — those routes could not return 400 for this
  reason before. A sequence step whose template does not parse is marked
  `failed` rather than retried forever. (#112)
- Template `variables` payloads may nest objects and arrays up to 32 levels
  deep; deeper is rejected with `400` naming the limit. Zod's recursive descent
  through the self-referencing value schema has no bound of its own, so a
  payload of a few KB but thousands of levels deep overflowed the stack — a
  `RangeError`, which is not a `ZodError` and so surfaced as an unhandled 500.
  The guard applies on every send path, including the MCP tools. (#227)
- Templates are validated when they are written. `POST` and `PUT
/api/email-templates` reject a template whose tags do not parse, with the
  diagnostic naming the offending tag. Previously a broken template stored
  cleanly and failed much later — on every send, on `/variables`, and by
  marking sequence steps `failed` terminally, with a worker log as the only
  trace. `PUT` validates the template as it will exist after the merge, since
  editing only the subject can still unbalance a section across the pair.
  (#227)
- The template editor understands the full grammar. Detected variables are
  grouped into Required / Optional / Sections with each chip showing the tag as
  written (`{{^promo}}`, `{{#promo?}}`, `{{name?}}`), the live preview
  substitutes sample values so a section renders as repeated content, and a
  "Syntax & styling" card documents the tag table, escaping, and multi-line
  values. The editor now renders through the worker's own renderer rather than
  a copy, so the preview and the chips cannot disagree with what a send does.
  (#112)
- The sequence editor's enroll snippet and the template list's variable badge
  use the same analyzer. Both previously scanned for `{{name}}` with a regex
  that, for a section template, collected the per-item names the endpoint
  ignores and omitted the section name it rejects the request for — so the
  snippet was copy-pasteable into a `400`. The snippet now shows a section as
  an array of its own fields. (#112)
- Section nesting is capped at 64 levels; deeper templates are rejected as a
  parse error rather than overflowing the renderer's stack. (#112)
- Total section expansion is capped at 20,000 body renders per template, as
  `TEMPLATE_RENDER_ERROR` (a parse error to every caller). The 64-level cap
  bounds how deep a template nests and the variables cap bounds the payload,
  but neither bounds their product: a section nested inside itself cannot
  resolve the inner name against the item frame, so it falls back to the same
  top-level array and iterates it again, making work grow as N^depth from a
  few hundred bytes of template. A 20-element array nested 8 deep asks for
  2.6e10 renders. (#112)

### Changed

- **Behavior change:** a template variable used inside a section that creates
  no per-item scope is now validated, and a send that omits it fails with
  `400` instead of substituting nothing. A section only scopes its body when
  its value is an array or an object; an inverted `{{^key}}` section, and a
  `{{#key}}` section given a boolean, render against the top level, so names
  in those bodies are ordinary top-level lookups. Previously they were treated
  as per-item and blanked, so `{{^has_orders}}Hi {{first_name}}{{/has_orders}}`
  mailed "Hi ," and reported success. Names inside an _iterating_ section still
  render empty when absent, since items legitimately differ in which optional
  fields they carry. These names do not appear in
  `GET /api/email-templates/{slug}/variables`, which is a static analysis and
  cannot know what value a section will receive — the check happens at send
  time. Sequence sends are unaffected; they have no failure channel and keep
  rendering as before. (#112)
- **Behavior change:** a variable used in scalar position that receives an
  object or an array is rejected with `400` rather than rendering as an empty
  string. Before the payload schema widened this was unrepresentable; now it
  parses cleanly and mails a blank. Names used as sections are unaffected, so
  boolean conditional sections keep working. (#112)

- **BREAKING:** Template variables are now HTML-escaped by default. `{{name}}`
  escapes its value; use `{{{name}}}` to pass pre-rendered HTML through
  unescaped. Templates that intentionally rendered HTML from a variable must
  switch those tags to the triple-brace form. Affects both the templates API
  and sequence sends. Escaping applies to the HTML body; the subject line is
  a plain-text header and is substituted as-is, as it always was. (#227)
- **BREAKING:** Templates containing three or more consecutive braces now
  parse differently, because `{{{key}}}` means raw output. Previously
  `{{{name}}}` rendered as `{` + the value + `}`; it is now an unescaped
  substitution. Templates that only use `{{key}}` and ordinary text are
  unaffected. (#112)
- `GET /api/email-templates/{slug}/variables` returns three lists. `variables`
  keeps its name, its `string[]` type, and its meaning — the names a caller
  must supply or the send is rejected — so existing integrations are
  unaffected. Alongside it, `optional` carries names that render empty when
  absent (`{{key?}}` tags and inverted sections), and `sections` carries each
  section's name, whether it is inverted, and the names its body references.
  Section-body names stay out of `variables`: they resolve against the current
  item at render time, so listing them would suggest a contract that does not
  exist. (#112, #227)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Spam score column: inbound emails now capture the upstream `X-Spam-Score` header and store it as a nullable `spam_score` (real) column on the `emails` table. Migration `0028`.
- Failed-send status indicator: sends rejected by the provider are now surfaced in both chat-bubble and thread views with a "Failed to send" badge and red tint. The `status` field is exposed on conversation and single-email API endpoints.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `actions/checkout` from 6 to 7.
- Bumped the radix-ui group with 7 updates (`@radix-ui/react-avatar`, `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-label`, `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area`, `@radix-ui/react-separator`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`).
- Bumped the tiptap group with 5 updates.
- Bumped the cloudflare dev-dependency group with 4 updates.
- Bumped the better-auth group with 2 updates.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Outbound webhook on inbound messages: configure a target URL via the admin API-keys page and saasmail will POST a `message.received` payload (signed with HMAC-SHA256) whenever a new email arrives. Downstream services can react in real time without polling.
  - `GET /api/admin/webhooks` / `PUT /api/admin/webhooks` / `POST /api/admin/webhooks/test` admin endpoints backed by `app_settings`.
  - HMAC-SHA256 `X-Saasmail-Signature` header on every delivery; delivery is best-effort (fire-and-forget, non-blocking).
  - Frontend webhook config UI on the API-keys admin page.
  - In-app signature-verification guidance: a copyable AI prompt generates verifier code for your stack.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `hono` from 4.12.23 to 4.12.25.
- Bumped `dompurify` from 3.4.9 to 3.4.11.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Inbox refresh: mobile pull-to-refresh (rubber-band indicator while fetching) and a desktop refresh button in the inbox toolbar. Both share a single `refreshPeople` path that re-fetches in place without flashing the full-pane loading state.
- Re-target a message to a different or new person. New `PATCH /api/emails/:id/person` accepts `{ email?, name?, fromAddress? }` and handles both received and sent messages: for a received message it re-attributes the sender's person; for a sent message — e.g. a contact-form notification mailed from a generic address with the real submitter in the body — it re-attributes the person AND rewrites the stored `toAddress` so a reply reaches them, with an optional `fromAddress` to switch the sending identity. Conversation threading is left intact and per-person counts recomputed. In the UI: a per-message "Reassign" control on both received and sent messages (pre-filled from the inbound `Reply-To` when present), plus inline-editable From/To rows in the message viewer for sent messages.

### Performance

- Added database indexes for hot query paths to avoid full table scans: `emails.conversation_id` and `sent_emails.conversation_id` (group thread lookups), `sent_emails.(from_address, sent_at)` (inbox-scoped sent listings), `users.role` (inbound-email admin fan-out), and `invitations.created_at` / `suppressions.created_at` (list ordering). Migration `0027` uses `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, so re-applying is safe.

### Dependencies

- Bumped the radix-ui group with 7 updates (`@radix-ui/react-avatar`, `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-label`, `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area`, `@radix-ui/react-separator`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`).
- Bumped the tiptap group (`@tiptap/extension-image`, `@tiptap/extension-placeholder`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`) from 3.24.0 to 3.26.1.
- Bumped the cloudflare dev-dependency group (`@cloudflare/vite-plugin` 1.39.0 → 1.40.2, `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.16.10 → 0.16.15, `@cloudflare/workers-types` 4.20260601.1 → 4.20260615.1, `wrangler` → 4.100.0).
- Bumped the better-auth group (`@better-auth/passkey`, `better-auth`) from 1.6.11 to 1.6.18.
- Bumped the testing dev-dependency group (`@playwright/test` 1.60.0 → 1.61.0, `@vitest/runner`, `@vitest/snapshot`, `vitest` 4.1.7 → 4.1.9).
- Bumped `hono` from 4.12.18 to 4.12.23.
- Bumped `@codemirror/view` from 6.43.0 to 6.43.1.
- Bumped `vite` from 7.3.2 to 7.3.5.
- Bumped `dompurify` from 3.4.0 to 3.4.9.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Suppression list with admin UI at `/admin/suppressions` and CRUD API at `/api/suppressions` (admin-only).
- Public unsubscribe page at `/unsubscribe?token=…` with one-click POST handling and a re-subscribe button.
- `List-Unsubscribe` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` (RFC 8058) headers on marketing sends.
- Template variable `{{unsubscribe_url}}` available in marketing email templates. If the rendered body doesn't include the URL, an unsubscribe footer is auto-appended (HTML and plaintext).
- `transactional: boolean` flag on `POST /api/send` (default `false`) to bypass suppression checks and unsubscribe injection for account-critical mail (password resets, OTPs, system notifications).
- `suppressed: string[]` field on the `POST /api/send` response, listing recipients that were dropped because they're on the suppression list.
- Sequence dispatcher and template preview/test send now respect the suppression list — unsubscribed recipients no longer receive scheduled or test sends.

### Changed

- **Behavior shift for API integrators:** sends through `POST /api/send` now have `List-Unsubscribe` headers added and (if the body lacks the URL) an unsubscribe footer auto-appended UNLESS the caller passes `transactional: true`. To preserve previous behavior for transactional mail (password resets, OTPs, etc.), set the flag explicitly on every transactional send.
- `POST /api/send` response: `id` is now nullable. When every recipient is suppressed, the response is `{ id: null, status: "suppressed", delivered: [], suppressed: [...] }` with no message dispatched.
- The `sequence_emails.status` enum now includes `suppressed` for steps dropped due to suppression.

### Configuration

- New required env var: `UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET` — Worker secret used to sign one-click unsubscribe tokens (HMAC). Set in prod via `wrangler secret put UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET`. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- The existing `BASE_URL` var is reused to build absolute unsubscribe URLs — no new `APP_URL` introduced.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Support optional `Reply-To` header on `POST /api/send` and the reply route.
- Inbound `Reply-To` is now surfaced on the single-email endpoint (`GET /api/emails/:id`).
- Inbox can be deep-linked to a filtered view via `?q=` query parameter; individual messages now have shareable per-message links.
- Admins can revoke invitations from the admin users page.
- Added `/use-saasmail` skill documenting how to call a deployed saasmail instance from Claude.

### Fixed

- Prevented iOS auto-zoom on focused inputs across forms.
- Sequence step delays now accumulate correctly so emails space out as configured instead of all sending at once.
- Wrapped `Reply-To` values in a mimetext `Mailbox` on the Cloudflare sender path so sends with a `replyTo` no longer silently fail.

### Dependencies

- Bumped the tiptap group with 5 updates.
- Bumped the cloudflare dev-dependency group with 4 updates.
- Bumped `resend` from 6.11.0 to 6.12.4.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-26

### Dependencies

- Bumped `@tiptap/extension-image`, `@tiptap/extension-placeholder`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/react`, and `@tiptap/starter-kit` from 3.23.4 to 3.23.6.
- Bumped `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` from 1.37.1 to 1.38.0.
- Bumped `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` from 0.16.6 to 0.16.9.
- Bumped `@cloudflare/workers-types` from 4.20260518.1 to 4.20260525.1.
- Bumped `wrangler` from 4.92.0 to the latest in the cloudflare group.
- Bumped `tsx` from 4.21.0 to 4.22.3.
- Bumped `@vitest/runner`, `@vitest/snapshot`, and `vitest` from 4.1.6 to 4.1.7.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- TipTap editor images are now resizable via drag handles.

### Fixed

- Quick reply in chat-bubble view now defaults to reply-all, matching the behaviour of the full reply composer.
- Image aspect ratio is preserved in chat-bubble HTML previews.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Outbound email attachments (≤25 MB, up to 50 files): compose, reply, and quick-reply drawers now include a paperclip button and drag-and-drop target for attaching files. Attachments are persisted to R2 and the `attachments` table; sent attachments are surfaced in thread and conversation detail responses.
- `attachments.kind` column (`'inbound'` / `'sent'`) distinguishes received from sent attachments in the database.
- `POST /api/send` and `POST /api/send/reply/:emailId` now accept `multipart/form-data` with the JSON payload in a `payload` field and files in `files` fields; total upload capped at 25 MB.
- Shared `AttachmentPicker` and `AttachmentChips` UI components reused across compose, reply, and quick-reply.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `@playwright/test` from 1.59.1 to 1.60.0.
- Bumped `@vitest/runner`, `@vitest/snapshot`, and `vitest` from 4.1.5 to 4.1.6.
- Bumped `@better-auth/passkey` and `better-auth` from 1.6.10 to 1.6.11.
- Bumped `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` from 1.36.3 to 1.37.1.
- Bumped `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` from 0.16.3 to 0.16.6.
- Bumped `@cloudflare/workers-types` from 4.20260511.1 to 4.20260518.1.
- Bumped `wrangler` from 4.90.0 to 4.92.0.
- Bumped `@codemirror/view` from 6.42.1 to 6.43.0.
- Bumped the tiptap group (`@tiptap/extension-placeholder`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`) from 3.23.1 to 3.23.4.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- HTML preview in chat inbox no longer shows a blurred overlay; content is readable at a glance with a persistent "View original" action, and the redundant "HTML email" tag has been removed (`ChatInboxSection`).
- Removed the fade-out gradient overlay that partially obscured HTML preview content in the chat view.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `kysely` from 0.28.16 to 0.28.17.
- Bumped `better-auth` group with 2 updates.
- Bumped `@codemirror/view` in the codemirror group.
- Bumped the tiptap group with 4 updates.
- Bumped the cloudflare dev-dependency group across 1 directory with 4 updates.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-12

### Security

- Closed stored-XSS surface on per-inbox signatures: a new HTMLRewriter-based sanitizer (`worker/src/lib/sanitize-signature.ts`) strips dangerous tags (`script`, `style`, `iframe`, etc.), every `on*` event handler, `style` attributes, and unsafe URL schemes (`javascript:`, `vbscript:`, non-image `data:`). Signatures are sanitized at write time in the PATCH inbox endpoint (with a 20 000-character schema cap) and on the client in `ComposeModal` and `ReplyComposer` as defense-in-depth.
- `inbox-permissions.ts` lowercases addresses at resolution time, closing a latent permission-check bypass for mixed-case `inbox_permissions.email` rows.

### Fixed

- `EmailHtmlModal`: converted a `useMemo` side-effect to `useEffect`, eliminating a "Cannot update a component while rendering" warning under React StrictMode.
- Send and reply routes now cap CC arrays at 50 entries and normalize `fromAddress`, `to`, and every CC email to lowercase at the route boundary, ensuring consistent `computeConversationId` results.
- Inbound CC entries are now lowercased, trimmed, name-truncated, and filtered through a regex email-shape gate before storage; capped at 50 entries per inbound message.
- Non-admin member can no longer fetch a sent email authored from an inbox they do not own via `GET /api/emails/:id` (previously returned 200; now returns 404).
- Removed dead `inboxMode` toggle, unreachable `ThreadInboxSection` branch, and related state from `ConversationDetail` (~130 lines).

### Changed

- Drizzle meta snapshots reconciled for migrations 0021–0024, fixing a `parent snapshot collision` that prevented `drizzle-kit generate` from running; missing `app_settings` table export added to `worker/src/db/index.ts`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Compose modal converted to a right-side drawer matching the Reply composer: Radix Dialog primitives, fixed-right layout, same header/metadata/editor/footer pattern. ⌘/Ctrl+Enter sends; Send disabled until To and body are filled.
- Inbox page chrome trimmed: page title removed, Compose button moved into the toolbar row, bottom gap eliminated.
- Compact density pass: tighter padding and spacing throughout to fit more content on screen at default Mac scale.
- Footer slimmed: tighter vertical padding, smaller pill padding and font sizes, ~30 px shorter overall.

### Fixed

- Inbox card height restored to a hard `h-[calc(100vh-13rem)]` so inner scroll regions function correctly and the footer stays fully in view below the fold.
- LoginPage error message now applies `text-destructive` for correct theme colouring.
- Sign out menu item added to the user dropdown (exposes `logout-button` test ID for E2E).
- User email surfaced as the accessible title on the dropdown trigger.
- WebGL shader disabled in headless/low-capability browsers to prevent CI rendering failures.
- Templates link wired into the navigation bar.
- E2E selector and actionability drift fixed across multiple tests to align with the updated UI chrome.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-07

A large UX/visual overhaul plus a new bulk-actions API. Frontend, brand,
and admin tooling all changed; the data model is unchanged.

### Added

- **Brand refresh**: lime + violet palette via Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens, Inter + Caveat fonts, animated GrainGradient backdrop on auth screens, soft pastel backdrop on the dashboard, mail-glyph favicon, OpenGraph image, comprehensive SEO meta + JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication`.
- **Top-nav layout**: floating dark pill nav with brand wordmark, route tabs, breadcrumbs strip, and a unified `Footer` (light variant for dashboard, dark variant for auth) — replaces the persistent left sidebar.
- **Inbox table view + filter toolbar**: new default view shows people as a sortable table with stats strip (people / unread / multi-inbox / with attachments). Single unified toolbar combines search, inbox dropdown, unread/attachments chips, and a List ↔ Table view toggle.
- **Bulk actions**: select multiple people via per-row checkboxes; floating `SelectionBar` exposes "Mark as read" with optimistic UI. Click an unread badge to mark just that person's emails as read. Per-inbox "Mark all in `<inbox>` as read" button on the active tab in `PersonDetail`.
- **Per-person tabbed inbox view**: when a contact has emailed multiple inboxes, each inbox is its own tab (short label, count, unread badge, mode dot) instead of stacked sections.
- **Drawer pattern for "View original" and "Reply"**: right-side animated slide-in (320 ms eased) with rich detail, From/To/ID/Time metadata, attachments with sizes, Rendered/Plain text toggle, copy-text. Reply drawer renders the email being replied to plus the surrounding thread alongside the editor (collapsible history).
- **Chat redesign**: sticky reply input always visible, day separators (Today / Yesterday / weekday), top + bottom fade affordances, "Jump to latest" / "New messages" pill when scrolled away from bottom, larger bubbles with shadow + ring.
- **Mobile-first overhaul**: floating compose FAB, full-screen drawers under `sm`, edge-to-edge inbox card on mobile, person tap opens full-screen, scroll-snap on inbox tabs, bottom-anchored selection bar with safe-area padding, larger touch targets (min 44 px), `text-base` on toolbar inputs to prevent iOS zoom.
- **Capability-aware animation gating**: new `useReducedAnimations()` hook detects `prefers-reduced-motion`, `navigator.connection.saveData`, slow connections, low device memory (< 4 GB), low core count (< 4) and renders a static CSS gradient fallback instead of the WebGL shader. Global CSS `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` zero-duration overrides for animations and transitions.
- **Reusable page chrome**: `PageHeader` and `PageContainer` components applied to ApiKeys, Templates, Sequences, AdminUsers, Settings, and Inboxes — consistent title / subtitle / action layout, capped at `max-w-[1600px]` to better use desktop real estate.
- **Inboxes admin redesign**: real `<table>` with bulk select header checkbox, bulk Thread/Chat/Delete actions in a contextual bar, inline display-name editing, per-row mode toggle, and a popover-based member assignment cell.
- **Public legal pages**: `/terms` and `/privacy` rendered through a new `LegalLayout` (light readable doc style) with content appropriate for self-hosted Apache 2.0 software (operator-as-data-controller framing).
- **API**: `POST /api/people/mark-read` bulk endpoint (with optional `recipient` scope); `GET /api/people/grouped` accepts `recipient` / `unread` / `hasAttachment` filters and returns a new `recipients: string[]` field.
- **Demo seed generator**: `seeds/generate-demo.ts` (run via `npx tsx`) produces a 100-person / ~700-email dataset across 6 inboxes for stress-testing UI behaviour. The committed `seeds/demo.sql` is unchanged — use the generator to overwrite locally.

### Changed

- **Default inbox view** is now `Table` (was `List`).
- **Default `displayMode`** for inboxes is now `chat` (was `thread`). Existing rows keep their explicit setting; only the fallback for rows without a `sender_identities` entry flipped. Tests updated accordingly.
- **`PersonList` is now controlled** — data fetching for the people list lives in `InboxPage` so both Table and List views see the same paginated data. Previously the fetch was inside `PersonList`, which made the Table view show empty state.
- **`InboxToolbar`** consolidates what used to be three separate components (search input in the sidebar header, filter bar above the inbox card, view toggle on its own row) into a single bordered bar.
- **Auth pages** (`Login`, `Onboarding`, `InviteAccept`, `SetupPasskey`) restyled with the glass-card pattern on the animated dark backdrop. Login flow simplified to `Continue with passkey` (primary) and `Continue with email` (secondary fallback).
- **Footer** is a single-row layout (Privacy/Terms pills · copyright · sponsor pill), with a `variant="dark"` mode for auth pages so it stays legible against the dark backdrop.
- **`PeopleTable` "Inboxes" column** shows the actual inbox names as chips (first 3 + overflow `+N`), not just a count.

### Fixed

- Table view scroll: nested flex containers need `min-h-0 + overflow-hidden` on the immediate parent to constrain inner scroll regions; wrapper around `PeopleTable` updated.
- Footer was painted over by the fixed `dashboard-backdrop-mask` overlay; mask gradient now fades earlier and `Footer` is wrapped in `relative z-10`.
- Right-side drawers now slide in via pure-CSS keyframes (`drawer-slide-in / drawer-slide-out`) rather than relying on tailwindcss-animate's specific class names.

### Dependencies

- Added `@paper-design/shaders-react` for the auth-screen GrainGradient. `vite.config.ts` adds `resolve.dedupe: ["react","react-dom"]` and `optimizeDeps.include` so the lazy-loaded shader doesn't end up with a duplicate React copy.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- Person-list search bar on iOS Safari: inputs with `font-size` below 16 px triggered automatic viewport zoom on focus. The search bar now uses 16 px text and a taller, more tappable input on mobile, reverting to the compact desktop size at the `sm` breakpoint.

### Dependencies

- Bumped the tiptap group (`@tiptap/extension-placeholder`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`) from 3.22.4 to 3.22.5.
- Bumped `react` and `react-dom` from 18.3.1 to 19.2.5; bumped `@types/react` from 18.3.20 to 19.2.14.
- Bumped `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` from 3.11.0 to 4.3.0.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-02

### Dependencies

- Bumped `better-auth` and `@better-auth/passkey` from 1.6.7 to 1.6.9.
- Bumped Cloudflare dev group: `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` 1.33.1 → 1.33.2, `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.14.9 → 0.15.0, `@cloudflare/workers-types` 4.20260423.1 → 4.20260426.1, `wrangler` 4.84.1 → 4.85.0.
- Bumped `@asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi` from 7.3.0 to 8.5.0.
- Bumped `@hono/swagger-ui` from 0.5.3 to 0.6.1.
- Bumped `actions/cache` from 4 to 5.
- Bumped `actions/checkout` from 4 to 6.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-30

### Dependencies

- Bumped `better-auth` and `@better-auth/passkey` from 1.6.7 to 1.6.9.
- Bumped Cloudflare dev group: `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` 1.33.1 → 1.33.2, `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.14.9 → 0.15.0, `@cloudflare/workers-types` 4.20260423.1 → 4.20260426.1, `wrangler` 4.84.1 → 4.85.0.
- Bumped `@asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi` from 7.3.0 to 8.5.0.
- Bumped `@hono/swagger-ui` from 0.5.3 to 0.6.1.
- Bumped `actions/cache` from 4 to 5.
- Bumped `actions/checkout` from 4 to 6.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Full-text email search via FTS5: the search box now surfaces people whose emails match the query by subject or body text, not just by name or email address. An `emails_fts` FTS5 virtual table is created with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE triggers to keep the index in sync; existing emails are backfilled on migration. For members, FTS results are scoped to their permitted inboxes to prevent cross-inbox content leakage. The search box placeholder is updated to "Search…" and a clear (×) button appears when text is entered.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- Clicking a Web Push notification now deep-links directly to the person's conversation instead of landing on the generic inbox view. Two bugs were fixed: `InboxPage` now reads `personId` from URL params and falls back to `fetchPerson(id)` when the contact isn't already in the loaded list; the service worker now `postMessage`s the target URL to any open same-origin tab (falling back to `openWindow`), and `App.tsx` adds a `/inbox/:inbox/:personId` route with a `NotificationClickListener` that calls `navigate(url)` on receipt.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Web push notifications now successfully decrypt in Chrome and other browsers: `deriveAes128GcmKeys` was appending a redundant `0x01` counter byte to the HKDF info before calling `hkdfExpand`, but `hkdfExpand` (RFC 5869) already appends its own counter byte for the first output block. The double-`0x01` caused "AES-GCM decryption failed" in `chrome://gcm-internals` while FCM silently accepted the malformed ciphertext. A known-answer test against the RFC 8291 §5 vector has been added to catch future regressions.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `postcss` from 8.5.9 to 8.5.10 (dev dependency).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Browser push notifications: users can now receive push alerts for new emails without the tab being open, powered by the Web Push Protocol (VAPID).
- `push_subscriptions` table stores per-user browser subscriptions.
- `GET /api/notifications/config` returns the server's VAPID public key so the frontend can subscribe.
- `POST/DELETE /api/notifications/subscriptions` for managing push subscriptions.
- `/deliver` endpoint on `NotificationsHub` Durable Object fans out new-email events to active WebSocket connections and falls back to Web Push when no WebSocket is present.
- Service worker (`sw.js`) that handles incoming push events and displays system notifications.
- Push orchestration library in the frontend (`usePush`) that manages subscription lifecycle, permission requests, and server sync.
- Contextual opt-in banner shown in the inbox when push permission has not yet been granted.
- Notifications settings page where users can subscribe or unsubscribe from push alerts.
- "Settings" entry added to the user dropdown in the sidebar for quick access to the new page.
- `vapid:generate` script (`scripts/generate-vapid.ts`) to generate a VAPID keypair for new deployments.
- VAPID configuration step added to the onboarding and update skills.
- `VAPID_SUBJECT` added to `wrangler.jsonc.example` and regenerated `worker-configuration.d.ts`.
- E2E smoke test covering the notifications settings page.
- Admin delete-person action: admins can delete a person and all associated emails from the person list via a new kebab menu, with a confirmation dialog and `DELETE /api/people/:id` endpoint.

### Fixed

- Web push is now always attempted when a new email is delivered; the previous logic skipped push if any WebSocket was open, even for other users.
- Push subscription UI in settings now surfaces errors, shows a loading state, and prevents double-clicks while a request is in-flight.

### Changed

- `NotificationsHub` Durable Object now captures `env` in its constructor so the `/deliver` handler can access bindings without passing them per-call.
- `/deliver` path on `NotificationsHub` now logs missing VAPID config, empty subscription lists, non-2xx push responses, and thrown `sendPush` errors instead of silently swallowing them, and warns if `VAPID_SUBJECT` is not a valid `mailto:`/`https:` URL.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `actions/setup-node` from 4 to 6.
- Bumped `github/codeql-action` from 3 to 4.
- Bumped `actions/upload-artifact` from 4 to 7.
- Bumped `@codemirror/view` (codemirror group).
- Bumped the tiptap group (4 packages).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Real-time inbox updates via Durable Object WebSockets: the inbox, person list, and open conversation now refetch automatically when new mail arrives, without any manual refresh.
- `NotificationsHub` Durable Object maintains hibernatable, per-user WebSocket connections keyed by user ID so only the correct user's connections are notified.
- `/api/notifications/stream` WebSocket upgrade endpoint; session and inbox permissions are validated in the main worker before the connection is forwarded to the DO.
- `useRealtimeUpdates` React hook that opens a WebSocket, reconnects on close, and fires a callback on `email_received` events.
- `wrangler.jsonc.example` now documents the DO binding and the required v1 migration for fresh deployers.

### Changed

- Emails are now marked read only when the user explicitly clicks the mark-read control. Auto-marking on conversation open has been removed because it conflicted with the upstream `onEmailRead` callback contract and broke the unread-count-sync test.

### Security

- WebSocket upgrade endpoint validates the `Origin` header against `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` to block Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Issue and pull-request templates, Code of Conduct, Dependabot config, CodeQL scanning, and `.editorconfig` for open-source community hygiene.
- Type-check step added to the CI test workflow.
- CI, license, and Cloudflare badges added to the README.

### Fixed

- Cloudflare Email Sending binding now works with custom headers (Message-ID, In-Reply-To): the sender rewrites outbound messages as raw MIME via `mimetext` instead of the object-form builder, which rejects non-whitelisted headers.
- Sidebar unread and total counts now update immediately when an email is read or deleted, instead of remaining stale until the next refetch.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Reply action is now available on sent messages, allowing you to continue outbound conversations from the person detail view.
- `/reply/{emailId}` endpoint accepts sent-email IDs in addition to received-email IDs.
- `message_id` column on `sent_emails` table; a standards-compliant Message-ID header is generated and persisted on every send, reply, and sequence delivery.
- `generateMessageId` helper in the worker for consistent Message-ID generation.
- Saasmail logo adopted as the default app branding; `APP_NAME` and `APP_LOGO_LETTER` environment variables removed.
- Email links inside message bodies open in a new tab.

### Changed

- Compose editor simplified to plain rich-text format with an enlarged modal.

### Fixed

- Reply endpoint now rejects sent-email IDs belonging to inboxes the caller does not own.
- Person detail header displays the contact's email address inline beside their name.
- Compose editor padding restored after accidental removal.
- Email attachments are now handled correctly end-to-end.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Initial release of saasmail — self-hosted email server on Cloudflare Workers.
- One unified timeline per customer, collapsing marketing, notifications, and support emails into a single per-person view.
- Multi-inbox support with per-inbox display names and team member permissions.
- Per-inbox display mode: render as **Thread** (traditional email threading) or **Chat** (bubble-style conversation).
- Inbound email via Cloudflare Email Workers.
- Outbound email via Cloudflare Email Sending (`EMAIL` binding) or Resend (`RESEND_API_KEY`).
- Admin UI to create and configure inboxes.
- Authentication via better-auth, including passkey support.
- Drizzle ORM schema and migrations backed by Cloudflare D1.
- Hono + Zod OpenAPI backend with Swagger UI.
- React + Tailwind frontend with TipTap rich-text composer and CodeMirror HTML editor.
- Person detail view with `ChatInboxSection` (bubble layout, pagination, plain-text quick reply) and `ThreadInboxSection`.
- Stats endpoint with per-inbox and per-person aggregates.
- Demo deploy mode (`deploy:demo`) for DB-only demo instances.
- Project scaffolding: Vite build, Vitest tests, Prettier, Husky + lint-staged, TypeScript strict mode.
